### Developer Portfolio 
### User Story

As a Web Developer, I want a portfolio that will showcase my skills, not only those I have learned in the course, but also ones I was able to pick up on my own. I want a website that features the following: An About me page, a Projects page, a Skills Page, and a contact me form. This should be a Single web page application rendering componants as they are requested.

### Features
This web application uses React.js and Tailwind to create a Single Web Page Application
The web page features a navigation bar which will take input from the user and render the requested componants
This page has an animation library used in the navigation bar.
This page features a project section with modal to see more information about the clicked project.
This page has a contact form with regex validation for email.
